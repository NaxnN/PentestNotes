With windows defender enabled, impacket-psexec and metaploit/psexec will not work.<br>
If WMI traffic is enabled  through the Windows Firewall, we can use impacket-wmiexec. Then `powershell -c "Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true"`(double quotes!)<br>
Or open a windows VM and use psexec.exe.(`wine psexec` does not work)
