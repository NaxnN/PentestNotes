`.` matches a single character, without caring what that character is. The only exception are line break characters.<br>
`\d` matches a digit, like 9<br>
`\D` matches a non-digit, like A or @<br>
`\w` matches an alphanumeric character, like a or 3<br>
`\W` matches a non-alphanumeric character, like ! or #<br>
`\s` matches a whitespace character (spaces, tabs, and line breaks)<br>
`\S` matches everything else (alphanumeric characters and symbols)<br>
Note: Underscores _ are included in the \w metacharacter and not in \W. That means that \w will match every single character in test_file.

`{12}` - exactly 12 times.<br>
`{1,5}` - 1 to 5 times.<br>
`{2,}` - 2 or more times.<br>
`*` - 0 or more times.<br>
`+` - 1 or more times.


Also, you can set a character as optional in your pattern using the `?` question mark. That means that `abc?` will match `ab` and `abc`, since the `c` is optional.
